## <div align="center"> DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS
**Age, Gender and Ethnicity detection**
  
* Explored the problem of predicting three attributes related to human face based on a research article of a Computer Vision group in Zurich.
* Applied Neural Networks for face recognition and feature extraction to detect age, gender and ethnicity.
* Used transfer learning to leverage a pre-trained model to enhance accuracy and obtained 98% accuracy for age and gender and  about 55% accuracy for ethnicity due to unbalanced classes.

**Flood Detection Through Imagery**

* Worked in a team of 3 to build a binary classification and object detection model to classify flood and detect the depth of the flood using Neural networks and transfer learning.
* Obtained an accuracy of about 60% with 1000 images.

**Ames Housing Prices**

* Participated in a Kaggle competition aimed at identifying which features are best predictors of housing prices in Ames, Iowa. 
* Explored the process of Data Cleaning, EDA analysis, Feature Engineering and Machine Learning Modeling to obtain a low Root Mean squared Error.
* Posted a blog post related to this project on Medium.

**Water Quality monitoring with Aerial Drones**

* Participated in Hack The Bay & Delta hackathon to make monitoring water quality a reality. Worked along a team of User experience to build a user interface to effectively and intuitively show conditions to inform resource management efforts.
* Incorporated Machine learning to predict water quality based on atmospheric and other factors.
* Leveraged QGIS, Scipy and Matplotlib tools to interpolate and superimpose the contours onto the map.

**Subreddit Classification**

* Used pushshift’s API to query data from two subreddits(Bitcoin and Ethereum) and build classification models to distinguish between the crypto currencies based on their posts/comments.
